## Overview
**LLAMA First Aid** is an intelligent, web-based assistant designed to provide immediate, step-by-step guidance for first aid during medical emergencies. Powered by the **Meta LLaMA** (Large Language Model Meta AI), this app leverages advanced natural language processing capabilities to understand critical situations and deliver real-time, personalized first aid instructions. Built with **Streamlit**, LLAMA First Aid offers a user-friendly interface that allows anyone—whether trained or not—to respond effectively in a medical emergency.

The name **LLAMA** is not only a fun reference to the friendly, woolly animal, but also an acronym that reflects the core purpose of our application. Just like **Meta’s LLaMA** model processes complex language, **LLAMA First Aid** processes emergency situations and generates clear, actionable advice for users in real-time.

### The Power of LLaMA Technology in LLAMA First Aid
While **Meta’s LLaMA** (Large Language Model Meta AI) refers to one of the most advanced AI language models available, our **LLAMA First Aid** app carries the same acronym. The shared name highlights the synergy between cutting-edge AI and life-saving applications:

- **L**ife-saving  
- **L**ive  
- **A**ssistant  
- **M**edical  
- **A**ssistance  

The acronym **LLAMA** in our app stands for a **Live Assistant for Medical Assistance** designed to save lives during emergencies. In a similar fashion, **Meta’s LLaMA** model processes human language, while **LLAMA First Aid** processes emergency medical data to provide life-saving instructions.
