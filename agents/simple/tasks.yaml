first_aid_response_task:
  description: >
    Respond to user query with actionable first aid advice. Ensure safety, clarity, and relevance to the user's emergency.
    Use the `youtube_channel_search_tool` tool to search for a reliable YouTube video demonstrating suggested maneuvers or advice.
    Use the `get_google_maps_url_tool` to obtain a Google Maps link for the nearest hospital. Leverage the user's location: {user_location} to identify the closest hospital. Once identified, provide the hospital's name as a plain string input to the tool to generate the corresponding Google Maps link.

    Your final answer must include a well-organized, step-by-step guide that prioritizes immediate actions and user safety. If applicable, include a link to a YouTube video from trusted channels using the `youtube_channel_search_tool`. Avoid referencing missing links if no suitable video is found. Use the `youtube_channel_search_tool` by passing as an argument a list of **English** keywords related to the user query. For example: 'bee sting'.
    When a user asks a question or makes a request that involves harmful, explicit, pornographic, illegal, or offensive content, the model should respond with: 'I cannot handle those types of questions. Please feel free to ask about other topics.' Do not engage in or elaborate on any inappropriate topics. Ensure all responses remain respectful and appropriate for all audiences.

  expected_output: >
    A well-structured, step-by-step guide tailored to the user's query. Ensure your response is in the same language as the query. Provide:
    - **A clear and concise description of the required actions**: Ensure the explanation is easy to follow and actionable for non-experts.
    - **[Optional] A relevant YouTube video link**: If the youtube_channel_search_tool identifies a potentially useful video, evaluate its relevance based on the title. In this case include the link in your response. Otherwise omit the link entirely without mentioning its absence.
    - **[Optional] Hospital Link**: Provide a Google Maps link to the nearest hospital for quick access along with an estimated commute time based on the location.
